New Drupal install
==================

extract zen
  (http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/zen-7.x-5.4.tar.gz)
  into sites/all/themes
git clone summerton into sites/all/themes
git clone jQuery-Knob into summerton/js/knob

Install the following modules by downloading the 7.x-x.x versions and
extracting into sites/all/modules/contrib
* CTools (https://drupal.org/project/ctools)
* OAuth (https://drupal.org/project/oauth)
* Views (https://drupal.org/project/views)
* Twitter (https://drupal.org/project/twitter)
* twitter_pull (https://drupal.org/project/twitter_pull) modules.

Log in to Drupal; go to appearance
Enable summerton as default theme

Go to modules, enable PHP filter module and twitter_pull module.  Configure
the twitter module; you need to fill in the OAuth information in the
"settings" tab (and uncheck the "import" checkbox at the top of that page).
You will also need to add an authenticated twitter account (probably
@givingwhatwecan).  Note that you will probably not be able to do this unless
the site is accessible from the internet.

Go to configuration->text formats
Add "Unfiltered HTML" type with no filter options checked

Go to structure->content types
Add content types as described in db_content/content-types.txt

Go to structure->blocks
Remove all existing blocks from header and footer (set region to "None"), and
  save.
Add blocks according to db_content/blocks.txt

Add some content according to db_content/pages.txt

Go to configuration->site information
Set default front page to node/1

Go to structure->menus
Select List Links for Main Menu
uncheck Home
